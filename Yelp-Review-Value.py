##Testing
test="""Here in Montr√©al on business (still) and I've been eating well for the most part, but I had a craving for a nice, juicy burger since I've seen this place while walking around downtown, so let's try it! Here's how it went. Atmosphere/Appearance: This place is quaint and tucked right on Rue Crescent. There is only street parking, so good luck with that. Lol. Once inside you're immediately met with the bar on the right and a line of 2-top/4-top tables that can be pushed together on the left. There's a very "homey" vibe here and I felt comfortable. It reminded me of just like, eating in someone's living room. Then you can go upstairs where there's another bar for the busy days and more seating. I really liked it in here. Service: The first time I came here Adrian took care of me and he was awesome. He took great care of me and made me feel so welcome. The 2nd time I came I got takeout, but was treated with the same respect as if I were dining in. Food: My first time I came I got the Brie & Mushroom AAA Bison Burger. LAWD! It was fantastic. It was so juicy, meaty, savory and just amazing. I upgraded my fries to sweet potato fries and they were too... fantastic. Burger Bar KILLED it. So while I was perusing the menu, I noticed they had wings. Y'all know how I feel about wings, so say no more. 2 days after that burger (likely a Wednesday for Wing Wednesday), I came back and got an order or Buffalo Blue wings as well as their Extra Spicy wings. They were so good! The burger was a bit better, but still the wings were fire FOR SURE. I'd totally come back for them. Value: (All prices are in $CAD.) My burger was $24.00 and to add the sweet potato fries was $3.95. My wings were $16.00 each and you get 10 in an order. Very good value for the quality of food that you get. In conclusion, I LOVED this place and it's easily one of my favorite places in Montr√©al to eat. I will absolutely come back here when I return for future visits."""

test2="""A great Burger place! I ordered the Boss burger and onion rings for take-out. Juicy burger with bacon,tomatoes, American cheese topped with a fried egg. Once you have their burgers you won't go anywhere else. They have everything from burgers to poutine to Mac and Cheese and  milkshakes. Whatever your heart desires they have it. Can't wait to sit inside and try the hang-over burger. It's so big that you have to eat in.. bahaha! Love it!"""
